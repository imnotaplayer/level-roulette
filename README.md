something i made that chooses levels randomly from a list where you can add those levels to a second list.

i made it to be used as:
```
get list
play all levels in list, adding ones i'd play again to the second list
swap lists
repeat until done
```

available commands are
`add`
`remove`
`swap`
`next`
`continue`
`exit`
`quit`

`add` adds a level to the active list.

`remove` removes a level from the active list.

`swap` swaps the active list and the saved list.

`next` and
`continue` choose another level from the active list. no input also does this.

`exit` and
`quit` saves the lists and exits.
